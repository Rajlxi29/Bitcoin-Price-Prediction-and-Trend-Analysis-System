# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-and-Trend-Analysis-System

🚀 Bitcoin Price Prediction – Web Application
Description:
A full-stack web application that predicts future Bitcoin prices using an advanced LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. The project seamlessly combines a powerful ML backend with a clean, interactive frontend for real-time price prediction and visualization.

🔑 Key Features:
🧠 LSTM Model Integration:
Trained a deep learning LSTM model on historical Bitcoin price data to forecast future trends.

🛠️ Flask Backend:
Built a RESTful API using Flask to serve predictions from the trained model.

💻 Interactive Frontend:
Users can input parameters and instantly view predictions via responsive, dynamic charts.

📊 Real-Time Visualization:
Used client-side JavaScript libraries like Chart.js to display historical and forecasted prices in a visually appealing format.

🧰 Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Flask (Python), LSTM (Keras/TensorFlow)

Machine Learning: Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Keras

Visualization: Chart.js / Matplotlib

Version Control: Git & GitHub

👨‍💻 Responsibilities:
🌐 Developed the complete frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🔗 Connected the frontend to the Flask API using fetch/AJAX for dynamic chart updates.

📈 Integrated Chart.js for real-time visualization of predictions vs. historical data.

🤝 Collaborated with backend developers to ensure smooth and efficient API integration.
